# Diabetes
Predicting the diabetes of the patient based on different parameters like Pregnancy, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age and so on. And have used several algorithms like Logistic Regression, NB, Random Forest, SVC algorithms, and predicted a accuracy of about 80.5%.  I've deeply explored and analyzed valuable insights by producing clear visualizations for easy understanding. 

> In this project, I have collected, throughly cleaned and visualized the datasets for clear and easy understanding. Furthermore, I have figure out the total amount of people who are healthy and the ones affected by diabetes. 
> Here, I've replaced the missing values or zero value of the columns - 'Glucose','BloodPressure','SkinThickness','Insulin','BMI','Age' by its median. I have visualized the dataset completely by using seaborn, matplotlib and plotly. Firstly, I have visualized each and every columns with the outcome column by using catplot. Also I've used boxplot to detect any outliers in the dataset. Furthermore, I have used histogram to easily understand the percentage of categories that are important for the cause of diabetes. And, by using some of the most important machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier. I've found accuracy of about 80.5% by using Randomm Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier.

### By this code you can easily understand:
1. Visualizing the people who are healthy and the ones affected by diabetes.
2. Replacing all the missing and null values with the median value of the own column.
3. Using different kinds of visualization for easy understanding such as catplot, boxplot, histogram, and heatmap by using seaborn, and matplotlib.
4. Have used several machine learning algorithms such as Ranform Forest Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier to train the model. And to find its accuracy.
5. Atlast, trained the dataset using these 4 algorithms and found the best one with 80.5% accuracy by using SVM and Random Forest Classifier.
